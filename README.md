# scripts

This is the script repository of WISH Pool.  It holds administrative scripts that can be used when 
managing your nodes.

All of these scripts were created by myself to simplify administration although the underlying
technology and programs are created by their respective authors e.g. IOG, Andrew Westberg, etc.

These scripts were created correct at the time of upload and for my particular environment.  
Please review the commands inside the scripts especially the file locations and variables e.g. Port
according to your environment prior to running the scripts.

While care has been done to ensure that none of the scripts are destructive, please make sure you
understand what each script is doing before running them as there may be some peculiarities to your
particular environment.  Thank you.
